The current folder contains the documentation and the matlab code for the master thesis on Cooperative Localization.
The Matlab scripts are categorised as follows:

1) Data . It generates data for the connectivity model based on the mobility model and the range model

2) savic. It yields the probabilities with respect to the connectivity model proposed by savic and zazo.

3) connection. The scipt generates the connectivity status with resepct to the proposed Markovian model.

4) factorize. The script corresponds to the calibration strategy.
